                <p>In my free time, I love learning! Astronomy has always held a special place in my heart - what can I say I love looking up at the sky and discovering new facts about space! I am also very much interested in video games! My favorite franchise being the Legend of Zelda. Growing up my parents were very much into play Super Mario. I loved watching them play and the fun we had together so it always stuck with me! And of course coding! It is such a rewarding passion of mine - sometimes difficult but oh so rewarding when you fix a bug and get your code working. Plus, with coding the learning never stops!</p>
